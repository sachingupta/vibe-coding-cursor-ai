## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd quote-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How It Works

The app tries to fetch quotes from the [Type.fit API](https://type.fit/api/quotes). If the API is unavailable, it falls back to a curated collection of motivational quotes stored locally.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Hooks** - State management
